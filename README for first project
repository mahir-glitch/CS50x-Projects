🚗 NO HESI  – My First CS50x Scratch Project

Welcome to my Car Dodger project! This is my first project for the CS50x course, where I explored the basics of programming and game design using Scratch.

In this game, you control a car and try to dodge incoming trucks. Each truck you successfully avoid increases your score, and the game gets progressively more challenging as the trucks move faster. If a truck collides with your car, the game ends.

🕹️ How to Play

Use the arrow keys 'W' and 'S' to switch your car between two lanes.

Dodge the trucks that spawn from the right-hand side of the screen.

Earn points for every truck you successfully avoid.

Try to get the highest score possible!

🎯 Key Concepts Explored

Variables and Score Tracking: keeping track of the player’s score and collision state.

Randomness: spawning trucks in one of two lanes randomly.

Loops and Timing: using forever loops to move trucks smoothly and detect collisions.

Conditionals: checking for collisions and when trucks go off-screen.

Event Handling: starting the game and ending it using broadcasts.

This project helped me understand the fundamentals of programming logic, event-driven design, and game mechanics, all within the visual Scratch environment.

📝 Notes

This project is saved as a .sb3 Scratch file — download it to play!

More advanced versions in the future could include multiple lanes, different types of obstacles, or power-ups.

Enjoy playing and learning with NO HESI! 🚦
