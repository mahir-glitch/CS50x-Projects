CS50x Projects

Welcome to my CS50x Projects repository!

This repository contains all of the projects Iâ€™ve completed as part of the CS50x course, from my first Scratch games to more advanced coding assignments. Each project demonstrates key concepts in programming, problem-solving, and software design.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals

Track my progress through CS50x.

Showcase my programming and problem-solving skills.

Provide clear, organised examples of my work for review and reference.

ðŸ’¡ Notes

Most projects include the code file(s) and a brief description of the concepts explored.

Projects may be in Scratch, Python, or other languages, depending on the assignment.
